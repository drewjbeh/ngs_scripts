# Custom scripts for NGS data processing

A personal library of scripts I have written to perform various specific (and possibly not very useful for general use) tasks on NGS data such as ribo-seq and tRNA-seq, and some more general tasks on any sequencing data.

Scripts are commented and (should) include a main comment to describe function and usage.
